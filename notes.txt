#########
# Step 1
Code affected: none
Created this file.

#########
# Step 2
Code affected: all .java files
Reformatted using the Google Java style formatter.

#########
# Step 3
Code affected: Fish.turnAround
Flaw: unnecessary if, leading to duplicate code.
Fix: replaced if statement with a single assignment statement.

# Step 4
Code affected: all .java files
Flaw: typing was incorrect on some variables.
Fix: Changed the method and variable typing between public private and package private.

# Step 5
Code affected: FishTankManager.move
Flaw: not concise and difficult to understand code
Fix: Changed the draw function with a try catch in case a future subclass is added without a draw
method.

# Step 6
Code affected: FishTankManager.move
Flaw: not concise and difficult to understand code
Fix: Changed the update function with a try catch in case a future subclass is added without a draw
method. Also changed variable names a and b to height and width for clarity.

# Step 7
Code affected: HungryFish.java Seaweed.wave
Flaw: concise code
Fix: extended fish to hungryfish and changed wave method name to move so that I could collapse
one of the functions in fishtankmanager.

# Step 8
Code affected: all .java files
Flaw: variable names
Fix: changed many single letter variables to height and width or other names to better depict what
they really represent.

# Step 9
Code affected: Bubble.move
Flaw: make it easier to use
Fix: Moved the code in FishTankManager so I can call Bubble.move for future use

# Step 10
Code affected: mostly FishTankManager and Creature
Flaw: inefficient
Fix: I made a Creature class that is abstract so I can call methods faster.
Issue with just using the whole methods so only have abstract methods for now.
Trying to make a new array system. This preliminary model works for now.

# Step 11
Code affected: Fish.java
Flaw: fish off screen
Fix: Used the screen resolution variables from FishTankView (copied and pasted since they are
private) and set them as boundaries in move and setlocation.

# Step 12
Code affected: all .java files
Flaw: coordinate system
Fix: Started making an Arraylist for fishes, also tweeked some of the width and height variables.

# Step 13
Code affected: Bubble.java and FishTankManager
Flaw: efficiency
Fix: I changed the storing system to an ArrayList of creatures and removed bubbles that would float
above the screen (y=0). I now need to fix an appearance bug with HungryFish.

# Step 14
Code affected: all .java files
Flaw: unclear variables. Also found an error with Hungryfish text not appearing.
Fix: changed them to vertical and horizontal because x and y axis are confusing.

# Step 15
Code affected: Creature Fish Bubble and Seaweed
Flaw: Parent class can hold more information.
Fix: unprivated some variables and set them in an overarching Creature parent class. Tried to fix
the text in MEHUNGRY from going off the screen.

# Step 16
Code affected: all .java files
Flaw: unclean code
Fix: I removed unnecessary comments and added javadoc to methods and class missing them. Looked over
the typing of each variable/method and changed them appropriately. Have not fixed the MEHUNGRY going
off the screen yet. Also removed imports that are no longer needed.


# Step 17
Code affected: Fish.java
Flaw: MEHUNGRY text went offscreen.
Fix: I reformatted the boundary to fix the MEHUNGRY issue

# Step 18
I added Human.java which interacts with all other creatures (other than bubbles because let's be
honest, they aren't creatures). He walks back and force randomly because, well, he's spongebob
and there is a 10% chance he will eat anything he touches, including fish, hungryfish, and seaweed.
I added the Javadocs for the class and fixed some of the docs for other classes as well. I also
added a getLocation to the Creature class in order to check for where each creature is. I also made
sure to check for the boundaries of the screen because the bottom has the buttons and the top has a
banner so I made minor adjustments to the boundaries.

# Step 19
Code affected: Fish.java Human.java and FishTankManager
Flaw: fish did not turn around upon touching the boundary
Fix: I turned humans and fish around on touching the border
